V@HuubBellemakers @mikoflohr Maar na abdicatie is hij juridisch onmiddellijk staatshoofd, toch?
p1017
aV@mikoflohr @HuubBellemakers Beatrix tekent voor troonsafstand en dan is WA automatisch Koning. Regels erfopvolging.
p1018
aV@mikoflohr @HuubBellemakers inhuldiging moet wel, maar maakt WA volgens mij niet tot koning.
p1019
aV@HuubBellemakers @mikoflohr Ogv art. 29 Gw kan parlement vlak na abdicatie nog wel snel een wetje aannemen dat WA het niet wordt. Geinig.
p1020
aV@nzalltOR @HuubBellemakers @mikoflohr Nee. Ons systeem is erfopvolging die, ogv art. 32 Gw, onmiddellijk is. Zsm daarna inhuldiging, maar &gt;
p1021
aV@nzalltOR @HuubBellemakers @mikoflohr Koning oefent vanaf de afstand onmiddellijk koninklijk gezag uit.
p1022
aVRT @JoelErwteman: @adewolff @mikoflohr @HuubBellemakers Zie 27 en 32 Gw. http://t.co/DrziFVD5al - abdicatie leidt tot opvolging. NA opvolgi\u2026
p1023
aVMisschien is een hashtag leuk. Tension Rises On day of new Overlord in Netherlands. #TROON. Zetten we daar wat objectieve observaties op.
p1024
aVEén lied komt vaak terug. Ik versta niet alles, maar iets met de Geliefde Leider die je beschermt, of zo. #TROON
p1025
aVHet Leiderschap wordt er trouwens van ouder op kind overgedragen. En waar je ook kijkt, overal hangen portretten van de Leider. #TROON
p1026
aVEen ingewijde vertelde me trouwens dat ze op sommige plaatsen zelfs verplicht zijn, die afbeeldingen van de Dierbare Leider. #TROON
p1027
aVOp TV al dagen vaderlandslievende programma\u2019s en muziek. Overal veiligheidstroepen. Er is iets op handen in dat land, da\u2019s zeker. #TROON
p1028
aVRT @adewolff: Het telecomnetwerk wordt er extra gesurveilleerd. Burgers zijn er afgesloten van bepaalde functionaliteiten. #TROON
p1029
aVHet grote buurland, waar de Dierbare Leider etnisch toe behoort, heeft extra troepen gestuurd om orde in de hoofdstad te handhaven. #TROON
p1030
aVOok in de koloniën van het land wordt het lied over de nieuwe Dierbare Leider aan de schoolkinderen geleerd. #TROON
p1031
aVDe koloniën, nu plechtig Gelijkwaardige Rijksdelen genoemd, zouden zelf  een dansbaarder lied hebben gemaakt, zegt een mevrouw daar. #TROON
p1032
aVRond paleis waar morgen in geheime zitting de oude Leider de macht overdraagt, houden veiligheidstroepen verdachte burgers staande. #TROON
p1033
aVBeperkte demonstraties worden gedoogd op afgelegen locaties, ver van de ceremonie. Heeft het land deskundig advies ingewonnen? #TROON
p1034
aVOp TV veel gelukkige burgers te zien die hun blijdschap over de nieuwe Dierbare Leider uitspreken. Ze zien er regeringsgetrouw uit. #TROON
p1035
aVAlle openbaar vervoer naar de hoofdstad rijdt vaker, waarschijnlijk om extra aanhangers vanaf het platteland aan te kunnen voeren. #TROON
p1036
aVVolgens het staatsjournaal staan alle mobiele telco\u2019s onder regie van de autoriteiten van het land. Nauwelijks verhulde waarschuwing? #TROON
p1037
aVIn kustprovincie dreigen etnische spanningen. 'Alleen eigen mensen op het podium, geen Zuiderburen!\u2019 zegt een lokale gezagsdrager. #TROON
p1038
aVJe ziet natuurlijk vaker dat lokale autoriteiten soms overijverig raken, om hun chefs in de hoofdstad gunstig te stemmen. #TROON
p1039
aVZeker wanneer de machtswisseling zo zorgvuldig wordt geregisseerd als hier ter plaatse. Dan zie je dat officials gespannen reageren #TROON
p1040
aVStaatsjournaal meldt dat 78% vh volk het Leiderschap steunt. Wellicht daarom zoveel maatregelen. Is een gevaarlijk laag percentage. #TROON
p1041
aVHet valt op dat presentatoren van het staatsjournaal zeer veel glimlachen en alle nieuws met een opmerkelijk opgewekte toon brengen. #troon
p1042
aVNaar verluidt wil de dissidente Witte Beweging de straat opgaan. Maar vooralsnog overheerst de kleur vh regeringsgetrouwe volksdeel. #TROON
p1043
aVVraag is wel of de Witte Beweging nog aansluiting heeft met het volk. Sinds het Leiderschap werd ingesteld zijn ze gemarginaliseerd. #TROON
p1044
aVRT @adewolff: Het lijkt erop dat de officiele doctrine, Sociaal Leiderschap genoemd, nog steeds de meeste aanhang heeft. #TROON
p1045
aVLangs de wegen naar de hoofdstad staan extra controleposten. Het luchtruim is gesloten voor alle verkeer. #TROON
p1046
aVOok het Staatsjournaal besteedt al dagen extra aandacht aan mogelijke bedreigingen van de nationale veiligheid en stabiliteit. #TROON
p1047
aVBronnen melden dat enkele reformistische parlementsleden geen trouw willen zweren aan de nieuwe Dierbare Leider. #TROON
p1048
aVOnduidelijk is of zij tot de Witte Beweging behoren. Wel hebben zij in het door het bewind beheerste parlement een marginale rol. #TROON
p1049
aVVan échte oppositie is in het land geen sprake. Verkiezingen leiden steevast tot grote overwinning van aanhangers van de Leider. #TROON
p1050
aVOver kind vd nwe Leider mag niets worden geschreven, maar het lijkt nu al duidelijk dat ook zij wordt klaargestoomd voor het bewind. #troon
p1051
aVWel lijkt de steun vh leger van belang voor het dynastieke Leiderschap. Verschillende familieleden vervullen hoge officiersfuncties. #troon
p1052
aVDe enorme inzet van troepen komt ook omdat de positie van het Leiderschap niet altijd vanzelfsprekend is geweest. #TROON
p1053
aVHeeft te maken met de etnische oorsprong van de Leider, die in het Grote Buurland ligt, waarmee de verhouding vaak gespannen is. #TROON
p1054
aVMaar sinds de invoering van de doctrine van Sociaal Leiderschap lijkt die historische wedijver naar de achtergrond geplaatst. #troon
p1055
aVBREEK: bronnen melden dat bepaalde legereenheden NIET aanwezig zijn bij de machtsoverdracht. Onduidelijk is of onvrede rol speelt. #TROON
p1056
aVBekend is dat sommige generaals tot de Witte Beweging behoren, maar hoeveel dissidente kazernes er zijn en óf zij in opstand komen? #troon
p1057
aVRegeringsgezinde ochtendkrant maakt vandaag prominente dissidente verdacht en brengt haar in verband met zgn. \u2018Marxistisch Festival\u2019. #TROON
p1058
aVDe krant was in het verleden al eens het instrument van rivaliserende leden van de kring rondom de Dierbare Leider. #troon
p1059
aVDe beschuldiging van \u2018Marxisme\u2019 ligt zwaar in dit land. Ook in het recente verleden werden hier veel \u2018marxisten\u2019 vervolgd. #troon
p1060
aVEr is een vrije dag afgekondigd en op straat worden extra goedkoop goederen aangeboden. De mensen stromen nu massaal de stad binnen. #troon
p1061
aVEen duidelijke opzet van het bewind om de steun van de straat voor de nieuwe Dierbare Leider zo groot mogelijk te doen lijken. #troon
p1062
aVOp TV nu opnieuw het lied voor de nieuwe Dierbare Leider, waarin zijn bescherming en zorg over land en volk wordt bezongen. #troon
p1063
aVDaarbij beelden van het zorgvuldig geplande interview met hem en zijn beeldschone vrouw, dat zijn populariteit zeer deed stijgen. #troon
p1064
aVEr waren zorgen dat de nieuwe Leider minder interesse en aanleg had voor het bewind dan de oude, die veel autoriteit had. #troon
p1065
aVMaar het tv-interview bracht de nodige omslag. De nieuwe Leider werd erin gepresenteerd als warm, ontspannen, en capabel. #troon
p1066
aVIn het land bestaat traditioneel grote etnische, sociale en culturele verdeeldheid tussen de stad en de rurale gebieden. #troon
p1067
aVSommigen vrezen dat, net als na de de-Russificatie van steden in de vm. Sovjet-Unie, het platteland de grote stad zal veranderen. #troon
p1068
aVHet Zuiden werd lang afwisselend bezet door naburige staten. Pas in 1866 werd het geannexeerd en onder het Leiderschap gebracht. #troon
p1069
aVDe houding van de etnisch en taalkundig verschillende bevolking in het Zuiden is ambivalent en wordt scherp in de gaten gehouden. #troon
p1070
aVHet bewind is mede nerveus omdat zeer recent nog een prominente Zuidelijke politicus zich tegen het Leiderschap uitsprak. #troon
p1071
aVEr is soms separatisme in het Zuiden, gericht op hereniging met etnische verwanten in de naburige landen. Maar de beweging is klein. #troon
p1072
aVVelen zien de Dierbare Leider als garantie voor eenheid en stabiliteit in een land dat grote etnische en religieuze verschillen kent. #troon
p1073
aVMet name buiten het 'Hollandse Hartland', waar de dominante groep woont, ontstaat vaak sociale onrust over de greep van het 'Westen'. #troon
p1074
aVIn het Oosten, Noorden en met name het Zuiden wonen andere bevolkingsgroepen, met een andere cultuur, geschiedenis, taal, geloof. #troon
p1075
aVDe grote vraag is of de nieuwe Leider dezelfde gehoorzaamheid weet af te dwingen bij alle bevolkingsgroepen als zijn voorganger. #troon
p1076
aVIn de hoofdstad ontstaan nu grote volksmassa's. Maar de staatsomroep negeert de ontwikkelingen en zendt louter kinderprogramma's uit. #troon
p1077
aVMet name buiten 'het Westen', waar de dominante groep woont, ontstaat vaak sociale onrust over de greep van de Westerse 'elite'. #troon
p1078
aVStaatsomroep meldt dat de machtswisseling 'grootste veiligheidsoperatie ooit' wordt. Ook 'kan' bewind opdracht geven 'te schieten'. #troon
p1079
aVHet bewind hecht er klaarblijkelijk groot belang aan eventuele dissidenten te waarschuwen voor ernstige gevolgen. #troon
p1080
aVBREEK: staatsjournaal meldt dat het kind van de nieuwe Dierbare Leider 'ook even op de Zetel heeft gezeten'. Een duidelijk voorteken. #troon
p1081
aVDe staatsomroep meldt op haar website dat alle radiofrequenties in de hoofdstad worden gemonitord. #troon
p1082
aVHet staatsjournaal kondigt aan dat morgen, juist als de nieuwe Dierbare Leider zijn taak aanvaardt, de Stralende Zon zal schitteren. #troon
p1083
aVOp TV is duidelijk te zien hoe 'spontane toeschouwers' worden geinstrueerd om blijdschap te tonen. Sommigen zwaaien ter bevestiging. #troon
p1084
aVZometeen zal de staatsomroep beelden uitzenden van getuigenverklaringen van mensen die de Dierbare Leider hebben zien opgroeien. #troon
p1085
aVOp TV wordt benadrukt dat morgen 'alle buitenlandse gasten' protocollair in lager in aanzien staan dan de nieuwe Dierbare Leider. #troon
p1086
aVOp TV wordt benadrukt dat morgen 'alle buitenlandse gasten' protocollair in lager aanzien staan dan de nieuwe Dierbare Leider. #troon
p1087
aVStaatsomroep vertoont waarschuwend programma over hoe bij de vorige machtswisseling de dreigende opstand succesvol werd neergeslagen. #troon
p1088
aVNu worden op TV de militaire verdiensten van de nieuwe Leider benadrukt door regeringsgezinde officieren.  #troon
p1089
aVNa zijn militaire ervaring worden nu zijn sportieve prestaties geprezen. Fysieke kracht wordt hier gezien als bewijs van Leiderschap. #troon
p1090
aVDe Dierbare Leider heeft gezegd 'hij ook best kan mailen met de premier'. Een aanwijzing dat hij meer beslissingen zelf zal nemen. #troon
p1091
aVSlechts 60% van de bevolking prijst politieke rol van de Dierbare Leider, meldt staatsomroep. Dat moet het bewind zorgen baren. #troon
p1092
aVBREEK: gewelddadig conflict gemeld in voorstad. Enkele bewoners weigeren beeltenis en kleuren van de Dierbare Leider aan hun gevel. #troon
p1093
aVHet is in dit land gevaarlijk om niet openbaar aanhankelijkheid te betuigen aan de Leider. Bevolking corrigeert elkaar. #troon
p1094
aVHet is duidelijk dat het bewind wil demonstreren dat de nieuwe Leider ook de opstandige delen van het land in de greep heeft. #troon
p1095
aVTerwijl hoofdstad wordt ingenomen door legereenheden en duizenden veiligheidstroepen, zendt de staatsomroep sport en kinder-TV uit. #troon
p1096
aVDe nieuwe Leider wees de premier al publiekelijk terecht met 'ik kan ook best even met hem mailen' (ipv gebruikelijke vergaderen). #troon
p1097
aVNu hij ook heeft gezegd dat hij zich wil richten op de economie is helder dat hij betere prestaties zal eisen van zijn ministers. #troon
p1098
aVProgramma na programma betuigen prominenten hun vreugde over de verdiensten en capaciteiten van de nieuwe Dierbare Leider. #troon
p1099
aVNaast algemene media kent het land ook speciale publicaties en journalisten die zich uitsluitend bezighouden met de Dierbare Leider. #troon
p1100
aVRT @TonyAgotha: Voorspelling: morgen raakt Twitter oververhit door commentaar en foto's van de abdicatie en inhuldiging.
p1101
aVOnduidelijk hoe sterk de Witte Beweging zich zal presenteren. Er zijn berichten dat de leiders onder verscherpt toezicht staan. #troon
p1102
aVOrdetroepen uit het Grote Buurland controleren op explosieven. Gevoelig, want de etnische oorsprong van de Dierbare Leider ligt daar. #troon
p1103
aVVolgens de staatsomroep zijn de ordetroepen voorbereid op 23 scenario's, waaronder massale dronkenschap van het volk. #troon
p1104
aVOpnieuw valt op hoeveel de presentatoren van de staatsomroep glimlachen en vreugde tonen wanneer ze de Dierbare Leider bespreken. #troon
p1105
aVHet staatsjournaal prijst het vermogen van het land om te organiseren. Dat is in het land van de vrouw van de Dierbare Leider anders. #troon
p1106
aVEen verslaggever van de staatsomroep is in de koloniën. Alle eilanden zingen om de oude Leider dank te zeggen. #troon
p1107
aVHet is klaarblijkelijk van groot belang te tonen dat het Leiderschap ook de afgelegen delen van het land stevig onder controle heeft. #troon
p1108
aVIn de koloniën bestaat een separatistische beweging, en een naburig land heeft ook claims gelegd op het grondgebied. #troon
p1109
aVEr zal de nieuwe Leider veel aan gelegen zijn om zijn gezag over de koloniën te doen gelden. #troon
p1110
aVZometeen zal de oude Leider het volk een afscheidsrede houden. Te verwachten is dat zij zal oproepen tot trouw aan de nieuwe Leider. #troon
p1111
aVZometeen zal de oude Leider het volk een afscheidsrede geven. Te verwachten is dat zij zal oproepen tot trouw aan de nieuwe Leider. #troon
p1112
aVDe oude Leider was 33 jaar aan de macht. Relatief kort, gelet op de directe voorgangers. #troon
p1113
aVDe oude Leider roept de gewonnen strijd tegen vreemde overheersers in herinnering. #troon
p1114
aVZe benadrukt hoe haar familie in de eenheid van het land een doorslaggevende rol speelde. #troon
p1115
aVDe oude Leider benadrukt dat het Leiderschap er uitsluitend is om het volk te dienen. #troon
p1116
aVRT @wenniewen: Lief! Beatrix over Claus
p1117
aVDe oude Leider dankt het volk voor de betoonde genegenheid en roept op tot trouw aan de nieuwe Leider van het onverdeelde volk. #troon
p1118
aVHet Leiderschap heeft Duitse, Russische en Franse etnische oorsprong. Het is niet verwonderlijk dat de oude Leider de #EU prijst. #troon
p1119
aVDe grote gebouwen van het Leiderschap worden na de plechtigheden opgesteld voor het volk. Een beproefde manier om ontzag te wekken. #troon
p1120
aVStaatsomroep demonstreert de technologie waarover het land beschikt. Vliegende camera, software om stemming onder het volk te meten. #troon
p1121
aVHet lijkt een boodschap aan het buitenland: het land beschikt over zeer moderne, geavanceerde middelen. Projectie van macht. #troon
p1122
aVDe staatsomroep prijst een burger uitbundig, omdat zij is geboren in 1980: het jaar van de machtsovername door de oude Leider. #troon
p1123
aVKennelijk wordt aan bepaalde geboortejaren, die samenvallen met belangrijke data voor het Leiderschap, zeer speciale waarde toegekend #troon
p1124
aVOndanks de vreemde etnische oorsprong sprak de oude Leider zeer goed Nederlands. Of de nieuwe Leider ook vloeiend is, is cruciaal. #troon
p1125
aVDe staatsomroep bezingt nu hoe de oude Leider in 33 jaar tijd het land tot gehoorzaamheid en aanhankelijkheid dwong. #troon
p1126
aVNu een documentaire over hoe voormalige dissidenten werden omgevormd tot trouwe aanhangers van het Leiderschap. #troon
p1127
aVDe staatsomroep poetst kritiek niet geheel weg. Er mag vrijuit worden gepraat over het ontwerp van het voetbalshirt uit 1988. #troon
p1128
aVBewind vh land is goed in mediabeheersing. Er wordt over problemen gesproken, maar ze worden nooit met de Dierbare Leider verbonden. #troon
p1129
aVOok worden soms dissidente meningen of figuren getoond. Maar deze worden snel geportretteerd als marginaal en zonderling. Zeer knap. #troon
p1130
aVHier in het land noemt men dat 'onschendbaarheid'. Daarmee wordt discussie verschoven van het Leiderschap naar politici. #troon
p1131
aVDe Leider lijkt niet altijd directe bevelen te geven. Veel vaker lijkt de kring rondom het Leiderschap zelf te handelen. #troon
p1132
aVDe staatsomroep meldt dat er morgen massaal aanhangers uit de rurale gebieden met extra treinen naar de hoofdstad worden vervoerd. #Troon
p1133
aVGrote verontwaardiging bij de staatsomroep om de respectloze vergelijking tussen de vrouw van de nieuwe Leider en Britney Spears. #troon
p1134
aVHet ging om een krant uit het buurland waarmee het land vier oorlogen heeft gevoerd. Een riskant moment in de machtswisseling. #troon
p1135
aVIn de grote steden heeft het bewind gezorgd voor veel vermaak op straat. Ook worden waren aangeboden tegen gesubsidieerde prijzen. #troon
p1136
aVDe staatsomroep roept in herinnering hoe een bekende Zuidelijke politicus eerder het Leiderschap ter discussie stelde. #troon
p1137
aVNu politici op TV die het belang benadrukken van het Leiderschap voor de eenheid en stabiliteit van het land. #troon
p1138
aVEen politica uit de hoofdstad benadrukt nu op TV dat het Leiderschap het land de democratie heeft gebracht. #troon
p1139
aVAan de Dierbare Leider worden vaak bijzondere persoonlijke kwaliteiten toegedicht. #troon
p1140
aVMaar nog even over Van Es. Ik ben voor wat we nu hebben hoor. Tisnieanders. Maar dat de Oranjes Nederland de democratie hebben gebracht:
p1141
aVBij de staatsomroep wordt toespraak vd oude Leider verschillend uitgelegd. Dit draagt bij aan de mythologisering van het Leiderschap. #troon
p1142
aVEen prominente dissidente aan tafel bij de staatsomroep, tussen zeven regeringsgezinde anderen. #troon
p1143
aVDe dissidente brengt het gesprek over de oude Leider soepeltjes van menselijke warmte naar olieslachtoffers van Shell in Nigeria. #troon
p1144
aVDe dissidente verbindt de oude Leider met politiek. Dat is een taboe. Overige gasten in verwarring. #troon
p1145
aVNa beschuldigingen van \u2018activisme\u2019 aan de dissidente roept een van de zeven andere gasten op tot dankbaarheid aan de Leider. #troon
p1146
aVNu veel aandacht voor de dictie van de oude Leider door de jaren heen. #troon
p1147
aVGast bij staatsomroep bewondert hoe de oude Leider niet alleen plattelandsbevolking, maar ook de intelligentsia wist te bedwingen. #troon
p1148
aVDe nieuwe Leider maakt duidelijk dat \u2018een tegengeluid mag\u2019 en roept ordetroepen op tot terughoudendheid. #troon
p1149
aVAan tafel bij de staatsomroep prijst men de enorme kennis en het geheugen van de nieuwe Leider. #troon
p1150
aVOok over de afkomst van de echtgenote van de nieuwe Dierbare Leider bestonden lang mythen. Deze worden nu uit de doeken gedaan. #troon
p1151
aVEr is bezorgdheid bij de autoriteiten. Er is nog niet voldoende volk naar de hoofdstad gekomen om de nieuwe Leider eer te betuigen #troon
p1152
aVEr wordt een document opgemaakt. Dat wordt gefilmd. Maar daarna vindt de machtsoverdracht in het geheim plaats, aldus bronnen. #troon
p1153
aVIn de machtsoverdracht zit geen tijd tussen de oude en de nieuwe Leider. Zo is gegarandeerd dat Leiderschap in familie blijft. #troon
p1154
aVVeel regeringsofficials. Ook zij moeten tekenen. Zo wordt hun persoonlijke medeplichtigheid aan de machtswisseling verzekerd. #troon
p1155
aVEr heerst lang en diep stilzwijgen in de zaal. Een duidelijk blijk van ontzag en bewondering vor de nieuwe Dierbare Leider. #troon
p1156
aVOok de lokale gezagsdragers van de buitengewesten onderwerpen zich met hun handtekening aan de nieuwe Leider. #troon
p1157
aVRT @tom_beek: Koningin, koning uit.
p1158
aVZodadelijk zal de nieuwe Dierbare Leider zich aan het volk presenteren. #troon
p1159
aVZoals bij Leiderschappen in andere landen zijn ook hier de symbolen en rituelen van recente datum en bedoeld om ontzag te wekken. #troon
p1160
aVOp straat is het rustig, overal de kleuren vd Leider zichtbaar. 33 jaar geleden, ten tijde van de Opstand, was de situatie grimmig. #troon
p1161
aVTerwijl de staatsomroep beelden uitzendt van het juichende volk, vindt binnen een geheime vergadering plaats. #troon
p1162
aVRT @Politie_Adam: Maakt u een foto van de balkonscène? Berg uw telefoon of camera goed op! Pas op voor zakkenrollers #troon
p1163
aVDe politie roept het volk op geen foto\u2019s te maken van het paleis van de Dierbare Leider, omdat \u2018zakkenrollers actief zijn\u2019. #troon
p1164
aVDoor de ceremonie \u2018komt nieuwe Leider in het lichaam van het Leiderschap\u2019, zegt de staatsomroep. De vergoddelijking van de Leider. #troon
p1165
aVHet is merkwaardig om te zien hoe het geselecteerde publiek op straat tegelijkertijd huilt en lacht van blijdschap. #troon
p1166
aVDe oude Leider beveelt de nieuwe Dierbare Leider openlijk om te wuiven naar het volk. Is hij minder in het volk geinteresseerd? #troon
p1167
aVVolgens bronnen wordt het oudste kind van de nieuwe Dierbare Leider nu al met een speciaal dieet in evenbeeld van haar vader gemaakt. #troon
p1168
aVBREEK: verschillende dissidente leiders gedwongen weggevoerd van het plein voor het paleis #troon
p1169
aVHet lijkt erop dat pogingen van de Witte Beweging zich te manifesteren worden neergeslagen door de ordetroepen #troon
p1170
aVEen zanger prijst op staatsomroep de jeugdige leeftijd vh volk op straat, waarmee de continuiteit van het Leiderschap is verzekerd. #troon
p1171
aVBewind is begrijpelijk nerveus. Bij vorige machtswisseling kwam groot aantal rebellen vlakbij het paleis. Er werden tanks ingezet. #troon
p1172

aVGerucht is 12-uurjournaal NOS dus. RT @Politie_Adam: Het gerucht dat er mensen aangehouden zouden zijn op de Dam in Amsterdam is NIET waar.

p7657
aV@MarijnPrakke Op de Waalsdorpervlakte meer aandacht voor verzet. Op landmachtkazernes Srebrenica/Afghanistan. Op Dam wordt iedereen herdacht
